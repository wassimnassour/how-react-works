# How hooks work

## Introduction
[Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) were introduced in React
v16.8.0, and since then they changed the way React apps were written.
Before them, we used to create class component for anything involving state
or lifecycle logic.
Hooks made function component the new defacto of writing react apps.

They were a huge addition that simplified a lot of things. I am not stating here
that they are better than class components, but they offer a simpler way
to reason about components and to deal with them, and especially they allow
escaping dealing with `this`.

This is not an explanation of React hooks themselves as they are pretty well
documented in the official documentation. We will see how they are written
into React.

## Context
In the previous sections, precisely in how function components get rendered;
we've seen that we set a `Dispatcher` based on whether your component is
mounting for the first time or updating. So first, let's demystify this
dispatcher.

## `ReactCurrentDispatcher`

in the [`renderWithHooks`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L556)
function, we set the `ReactCurrentDispatcher.current`. Which is a plain
javascript object with all the hooks implementations that React has.

The goal of having the dispatcher object is to limit the behavior of your hooks'
usage:
- You use hooks outside the render phase: This means that hooks
  won't work if you just decide to call the function component manually when
  React isn't rendering. You are probably familiar with the thrown error.
- Hooks behavior on mount and update isn't the same: as we will see later in
  this section, on mount, the main goal of the dispatcher is to `reserve` as
  place for your hook call and initialize it, but on update it will perform
  the update logic which is different.

Like we said, the dispatcher contains as many properties as React hooks:

```tsx
export const AllDispatchers: Dispatcher = {
  readContext,

  use,
  useCallback: hook,
  useContext: hook,
  useEffect: hook,
  useImperativeHandle: hook,
  useInsertionEffect: hook,
  useLayoutEffect: hook,
  useMemo: hook,
  useReducer: hook,
  useRef: hook,
  useState: hook,
  useDebugValue: hook,
  useDeferredValue: hook,
  useTransition: hook,
  useSyncExternalStore: hook,
  useId: hook,
};
```

There are several dispatchers, but we will only discuss the main four:

- `ContextOnlyDispatcher`: [This dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3408)
  will prevent you from using hooks outside the render phase. It will throw the
  famous `Invalid hook call` [error.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L440)
- `HooksDispatcherOnMount`: [This dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3446)
  contains hooks implementation for components when mounting for the first time.
- `HooksDispatcherOnUpdate`: [This dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3484)
  contains hooks implementation for components when they are updating.
- `HooksDispatcherOnRerender`: [This dispatcher](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L3522)
  contains hooks implementation when components are re-rendering: when they
  perform a render phase update or when they rendered twice in dev mode.
  

## How hooks are modelled
Each function component may have calls for any of the supported hooks. Remember,
all hooks calls occur withing the `renderWithHooks` function (exception for
the hooks for re-renders, they are called from within the `renderWithHooksAgain`
function).

Hooks are store into the `memoizedState` property of the [related `Fiber`.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L965)

A hook is stored inside React as a plain object with the following properties:

```tsx
const hook: Hook = {
  memoizedState: null,
  
  baseState: null,
  baseQueue: null,
  queue: null,
  
  next: null,
};
```

Where:
- `memoizedState`: contains the hook "state" (or value)
- `baseState`: used by state hooks to store the initial value
- `baseQueue`:
- `queue`:
- `next`: the next hook.

As you may have guessed, the `next` property references in the next hook your
component uses. Thus, hooks are modelled as a linked list of the previous
data structure.

Each hook have its own specification when it comes to what it stores inside
these properties, some hooks don't use all of these properties, obviously.

Notice how this data structure doesn't contain any information about the hook
being used, hooks relies on call order and should ALWAYS be preserved.

Dan Abramov wrote an [outstanding blog post](https://overreacted.io/why-do-hooks-rely-on-call-order/)
explaining this design choice.

## How hooks on mount work
The purpose on hooks on mount as stated before is to grab a place in the linked
list of the hooks.

So, all hooks implementations on mount will first perform the following:

```tsx
const hook = mountWorkInProgressHook();
```

The `mountWorkInProgressHook` function will create the previous data structure
and then set is as the `memoizedState` property of the `currentlyRenderingFiber`.

### `mountWorkInProgressHook` Implementation

The mount in progress hook function is implemented as follows:

```tsx
function mountWorkInProgressHook(): Hook {
  const hook: Hook = {
    memoizedState: null,

    baseState: null,
    baseQueue: null,
    queue: null,

    next: null,
  };

  if (workInProgressHook === null) {
    // This is the first hook in the list
    currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState = workInProgressHook = hook;
  } else {
    // Append to the end of the list
    workInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next = hook;
  }
  return workInProgressHook;
}
```

- First, it will create the hook object
- Then, if it is the first hook of the list, it will attach it to the
  `memoizedState` of the `currentlyRenderingFiber` and set this hook at the
  `workInProgressHook`
- Or else, it will attach it to the `next` property of the `workInProgressHook`.

And that's it!

Depending on the hook, other things will be performed, we will see them
separately for each supported hook.

## How hooks on update work

When your component is updating (not its first ever render), each supported
hook call will start with the following expression then will follow up with
the specific work.

```tsx
const hook = updateWorkInProgressHook();
```

[`updateWorkInProgressHook`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/77c4ac2ce88736bbdfe0b29008b5df931c2beb1e/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L973)
is a bit more complex than the mount one, but its purpose it to detect the next
`workInProgressHook` too. it used for both updates and re-renders, so it assumes
that there is either a `current` hook object that can be cloned or a 
`work-in-progress` from a previous render that can be reused.

The first part of this function then is to find the currently rendered hook
value. It will check the `current` rendered fiber's `memoizedState`
property if the `currentHook` module variable is null, or else it takes its
`next` property:

```tsx
// at module level:
let currentHook: null | Hook = null;

// inside updateWorkInProgressHook

let nextCurrentHook: null | Hook;
if (currentHook === null) {
  // the current rendered fiber
  const current = currentlyRenderingFiber.alternate;
  
  // already mounted
  if (current !== null) {
    nextCurrentHook = current.memoizedState;
  } else {
    // first mount
    nextCurrentHook = null;
  }
  
} else {
  nextCurrentHook = currentHook.next;
}
```

Now, after detecting the current rendered (painted) hook value, React will
then try to find its alternate (the being rendered one):

```tsx
// at module level:
let workInProgressHook: null | Hook = null;

// inside updateWorkInProgressHook
let nextWorkInProgressHook: null | Hook;

// first hook of the list, take it from the being rendered fiber
if (workInProgressHook === null) {
  nextWorkInProgressHook = currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState;
} else {
  // or else, it is the next hook
  nextWorkInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next;
}
```
It is important to note that when we start updating a component, the memoized
state property is reset and set to null.

Now, we have the currently painted hook value, and the being rendered one.

When there is a `nextWorkInProgressHook`, this means that we already have
started rendering then we are rendering again without committing and finishing
the render, and thus, we will reuse it as is:

```tsx
if (nextWorkInProgressHook !== null) {
  // There's already a work-in-progress. Reuse it.
  workInProgressHook = nextWorkInProgressHook;
  nextWorkInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next;

  currentHook = nextCurrentHook;
}
```

Or else, if the `nextCurrentHook` is null, that we are rendering more hooks
than the previous render, which is against hooks rules, and then React will
throw an error.
When `nextCurrentHook` isn't null, this means that we should clone the previous
hook and use it as a base:

```tsx
// React code

if (nextWorkInProgressHook !== null) {
  // previous code
} else {
  if (nextCurrentHook === null) {
    const currentFiber = currentlyRenderingFiber.alternate;
    if (currentFiber === null) {
      // This is the initial render. This branch is reached when the component
      // suspends, resumes, then renders an additional hook.
      // Should never be reached because we should switch to the mount dispatcher first.
      throw new Error(
              'Update hook called on initial render. This is likely a bug in React. Please file an issue.',
      );
    } else {
      // This is an update. We should always have a current hook.
      throw new Error('Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.');
    }
  }

  currentHook = nextCurrentHook;

  // clone from the currently painted hook
  const newHook: Hook = {
    memoizedState: currentHook.memoizedState,

    baseState: currentHook.baseState,
    baseQueue: currentHook.baseQueue,
    queue: currentHook.queue,

    next: null,
  };

  if (workInProgressHook === null) {
    // This is the first hook in the list.
    currentlyRenderingFiber.memoizedState = workInProgressHook = newHook;
  } else {
    // Append to the end of the list.
    workInProgressHook = workInProgressHook.next = newHook;
  }
}
```
