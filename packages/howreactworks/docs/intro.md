# Introduction

Hi, and welcome to this blog post series aiming to explain how react works
under the hood.

## What is this

This is a deep dive into react internals with the goal to explain the concepts
put into making react the tool you've been using for a couple of years now.

This is not a course or tutorial on how to use React, but more of an explanation
of React codebase. You don't need to know any of this to be a creative and
successful React developer.

The goal of this project is to explain how all the these things are made,
the concepts used and the important "code paths" to mention. We will go through
the following list:

- How createRoot() works
- How root.render() works
- How the work loop works
- How work tags work
- How Hooks work
- How each hook works
- How effects work
- How the scheduler works
- How suspense works
- How StrictMode works
- How feature flags work
- How bundling works
- How renderers work
- How Dispatcher works
- How Server side rendering work
- How RSC works
- How Float/Fizz work
- And so on...

This is an ambitious list of what this blog post series may achieve over time.
My theory is that this list can be made by different people initiatives.

_This is an ongoing project and many sections are either empty or are not added
yet. The goal is to have a newsletter that would notify you (if you want!) when
new content drops. Until then, and I hate to say it, you can follow me on
[Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/incepterr) to get notified when I drop
something new._

## Motivations

The React codebase is surely intimidating, and you will be overwhelmed
each time you visit it.

This project would explain all the needed pieces to be comfortable with React
codebase, not an easy task, but let's dream big and get going.

## Audience and requirements

This blog post series is destined to people that have used React for few years,
or that are willing to contribute to React, or that are curious to know how
React is written and how its code looks like.

The readers should then be familiar with the following React concepts:
- Component types
- Component lifecycle
- Elements Vs Components
- Effects, hooks
- Commit
- Reconciliation
And so on.

Understanding the requirements will be automatic if you've used React few years,
and this will help shorten these blog posts and focus on the main goal.

Moreover, if you are looking for React tutorials and content, here is my
recommendation:

- [The new React docs](https://react.dev/) are perfect and cover all
  the `official` information.
- [Kent's React course](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-a-beginners-guide-to-react-introduction)
- [Dan's blog](https://overreacted.io/)
- [Create your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) by Pombo
- [joshw comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/tutorials/react/)


## How will it go

Each section would contain a lot of links towards React codebase and
code snippets of either real react code or a simplified versions.

We will follow the natural react order, ie: I will start by explaining
the very first steps that we are told to do to use React: `createRoot`,
then the `root.render` function. Then will follow with what is done during
render, effects...
